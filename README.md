# Respawn Protection
A respawn protection script for Zandronum. This was created because the default respawn protection isn't customizable and does not work properly in LMS gamemodes.<br/><br/>
This WAD requested by the MDF community, for their LMS competitions.
<br/><br/>
### Configuration
Use the following console commands:
* sv_RespawnProtection_Time - Time to respawn (in seconds, can have decimals) (default 1.5)
* sv_RespawnProtection_FlickerSpeed - Flicker speed (larger value means slower flicker) (default 5)
* sv_RespawnProtection_StopOnAttack - Remove someone's invul if they attack (default false)
<br/><br/>
### How to use
  **1)** Include this WAD in your server's wad list.<br/>
  **2)** Ensure the Zandronum respawn protection is disabled (dmflags2 = 1024)
<br/><br/>
### Changelog
**Version 1.0**
